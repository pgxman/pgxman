Our installer script works on both Mac and Linux.

```sh
curl -sfL https://install.pgx.sh | sh -
```

After installation, pgxman will advise you on further requirements:

- [PostgreSQL](installing_postgres)
- Docker
  - on MacOS, Docker is used for our [container support](container)
  - if you plan on contributing extensions, Docker is used to build extensions locally with `pgxman build`

You can run `pgxman doctor` at any time to check if you have everything you need to use `pgxman`.

## MacOS: Homebrew

Install pgxman from homebrew:

```sh
brew install pgxman/tap/pgxman
```
