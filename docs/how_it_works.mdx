# How It Works

In short:

- Buildkits encapsulate metadata about the package-building process.
- When a buildkit sees creation or updates within the [buildkit GitHub repo](https://github.com/pgxman/buildkit), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/pgxman/buildkit/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yaml) builds the package and subsequently publishing it to a designated repository.
- Invoking `pgxman install` adds pgxman's repository to your system, followed by package installations through your system's native package manager.

## System Compatibility

The backbone of pgxman's build system is your system's package manager.
At present, `apt`-driven systems such as [Debian Bookworm](https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm) and [Ubuntu Jammy](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy) are fully compatible.
In the future, other package managers and operating systems will be supported. Currently, we are targeting:

- [x] apt
- [ ] brew
- [ ] rpm

## Extension Installation

### Apt

During the extension installation phase, pgxman adds its Apt repository to your system, enabling the installation of extension packages.
pgxman handles dependency management, installation, and uninstallation through `apt`.
Moreover, all pgxman packages are marked as 'hold back' with `apt-mark hold`, which prevents them from accidential installations, upgrades, or removals outside of pgxman.

## Buildkits

pgxman uses [a repository of
buildkits](https://github.com/pgxman/buildkit/tree/main/buildkit) to know what
extensions are available. When you use `search` or `install`, the buildkit
metadata is used to obtain information about that extension. A cached copy
of this repository is stored in the `pgxman` folder in your [user config
directory](https://pkg.go.dev/os#UserConfigDir).

Each buildkit specifies how to build each extension, and the buildkit build
system builds it for each package manager. When a buildkit is added or updated,
a build is conducted automatically (using Github Actions) and the packages are
stored in pgxman's repository.

## Building a buildkit

`pgxman build` uses Docker to build the buildkit packages locally. The result
is placed into the `out/` directory in your current working directory.
