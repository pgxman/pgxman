description: pgxman has container support in order to facilitate testing on any operating system.

<Note>`pgxman container` is aliased to `pgxman c`</Note>
<Note>On MacOS, pgxman automatically aliases `pgxman install` to `pgxman container install`</Note>

## Installing extensions

To install an extension into a container, run:

```sh
pgxman c install extension --pg version
```

* Containers use Postgres 15 by default. To use a different version, use the `--pg` flag to `pgxman container install`.
* Each version of Postgres is managed and run independently.
* Installation is persistent; you can install multiple extensions by running commands consecutively.
  Each time you install an extension, it will be added to the configuration, then build a new image,
  and restart the container with the extensions installed.

## Connecting to the container

The only thing you need to know to connect is the port number. pgxman uses the requested Postgres version
and then `432` to form the port number:

* pg16: 16432
* pg15: 15432
* pg14: 14432
* pg13: 13432

The username, password, and database are all set to `pgxman`. Combine these to connect to the database. You can use
any Postgres client, like `psql` or your favorite GUI client.

```
psql postgres://pgxman:pgxman@127.0.0.1:15432/pgxman
```

Alternatively, you can use `psql` from inside the container:

```
docker exec -it pgxman_runner_15 psql -U pgxman
```

## Managing running containers

Each version has its own named container, named `pgxman_runner_PGVERSION`, refered to as NAME below:

* pg16: pgxman_runner_16
* pg15: pgxman_runner_15
* pg14: pgxman_runner_14
* pg13: pgxman_runner_13

Now you can manage the container as follows:

* To **stop** a container, use `docker stop NAME`
  * For example: `docker stop pgxman_runner_15`
* To **start** a container after stopping it, use `docker start NAME`
  * For example: `docker start pgxman_runner_15`
* To **view** what containers are running, use `docker ps | grep pgxman`.

<Note>These commands will be integrated into pgxman in a future release.</Note>

### Database data

Data is stored a corresponding Docker volume, e.g. `pgxman_runner_15_pg_data`.
To see the volumes, run `docker volume ls | grep pgxman`.

## Container teardown

If you are done using a pgxman container, you can teardown the container. This will delete the image, volume, and
configuration. Any data stored in the Postgres database will be deleted.

```sh
pgxman c teardown pgxman_runner_15
```

## How it works

* pgxman generates a Dockerfile, a docker-compose file, and a pgxman bundle file. The configuration is stored in
`USER_CONFIG_DIR/pgxman/runner/PG_VERSION`.
  * On Linux, `USER_CONFIG_DIR` is `~/.config/pgxman`
  * On MacOS, `USER_CONFIG_DIR` is `~/Library/Application Support/pgxman`
* `pgxman c install` updates the pgxman bundle file, rebuilds the image, and restarts the container.
