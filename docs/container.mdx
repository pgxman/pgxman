title: "Using containers"
description: pgxman has container support in order to facilitate testing on any operating system
---

Implementation notes:

* On Mac, pgxman automatically aliases `pgxman install` to `pgxman container install`.
* Containers use Postgres 15 by default. To use a different version, use `--pg`.
* Each version of Postgres is independent.
* Installation is persistent; you can install multiple extensions in sequence. Each one will build a new image
  with the extensions installed in the image.
* The configuration for the image is stored in $USER_CONFIG_DIR/pgxmanrunner/PG_VERSION.
  * On Linux, USER_CONFIG_DIR is `~/.config/pgxman`
  * On Mac, USER_CONFIG_DIR is `~/Library/Application Support/pgxman`
* Data stored in the container database, including which extensions are installed, will persist outside of the
  container.
