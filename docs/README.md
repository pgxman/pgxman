# pgxman Documentation

This README is meta-documentation; it is not part of the pgxman documentation.

## Using mintlify locally

```sh
asdf install
npm i -g mintlify
mintlify dev
```

For more, see: https://mintlify.com/docs/development

## Adding a page

You need to add it to the navigation section in `mint.json`.

For more, see: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/navigation#sidebar

## Formatting

* use `.mdx`, `.md` is not recognized
* add yaml metadata at the top between `---` bars
  * `title` will be displayed as an `h1`, so do not repeat the title in the document
  * use `sidebarTitle` to have a shorter title displayed in the navigation

In addition to standard markdown, there are some mintlify-specific extensions
you can opt to use (custom XML that you can add to your file).

For more, see: https://mintlify.com/docs/content/page

## Deployment

Docs automatically update when a PR is merged, this is done by the mintlify Github app.

## Generated docs

Docs in the `/docs/cli`  and `/docs/man` directories are generated by the `make docs`
command from definitions in the `/internal/cmd/pgxman` code.
