## Optional: remove extensions

Note that extensions you have installed will continue to work even if you
remove the `pgxman` CLI.

1. Use [DROP EXTENSION][drop extension] to remove any installed extensions
   from your Postgres databases.
2. Uninstall extensions by running
   `apt remove postgresql-$VERSION-pgxman-$EXTNAME`.
   You can get a list of installed extensions with the command
   `apt list --installed | grep pgxman`.

## Remove pgxman

This will depend on how you installed pgxman.

- If you used the shell script, it installs pgxman via your package manager.
  - Linux: `apt remove pgxman`
  - Mac: `brew remove pgxman`
- If you installed pgxman via homebrew: `brew remove pgxman`
- If you installed the binary manually into your path, use `which pgxman` to
  locate the binary, then `rm` it.

## Remove pgxman config directory

This directory is located in your [user config directory][].

* Linux: `~/.config/pgxman`
* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/pgxman`

You can remove the directory using `rm -r`:

```sh
rm -r ~/.config/pgxman
```
