## Optional: remove extensions

Note that extensions you have installed will continue to work even if you
remove the `pgxman` CLI.

1. Use [`DROP EXTENSION`][drop extension] to remove any installed extensions
   from your Postgres databases.
2. Uninstall extensions by running
   `apt remove postgresql-$VERSION-pgxman-$EXTNAME`.
   You can get a list of installed extensions with the command
   `apt list --installed | grep pgxman`.

## Remove pgxman

This will depend on how you installed pgxman.

* If you used the shell script, it installs pgxman via an apt package. To
  remove the package, use `apt remove pgxman`.
* If you installed the binary manually into your path, use `which pgxman` to
  locate the binary, then `rm` it.

## Remove pgxman config directory

This directory is located in your [user config directory][]. Typically on
Linux, this is located at `~/.config/pgxman`:

```sh
rm -r ~/.config/pgxman
```
