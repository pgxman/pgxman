title: "Installing Postgres"
---

## MacOS

On MacOS, you do not need to install Postgres. pgxman will use a container to emulate a Linux environment. For
more information, please see [the container docs](container).

## Linux

You must manually install your desired version of Postgres; pgxman will not install Postgres for you.
You can either use the default version included with the distro, or use the Postgres Global Developer
Group (`pgdg`) repository. Postgres can also be installed from source.

### Included versions

- Debian Bookworm: Postgres 15
  - `apt install postgresql-15`
- Ubuntu Jammy: Postgres 14
  - `apt install postgresql-14`


### Other versions

We highly recommend using the Postgres Global Developer Group (`pgdg`)
Apt repository to install other versions. To add this repository, run:

```sh
apt install -y postgresql-common gnupg2

/usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.sh
```

Once the repository is installed, you can install your desired version of Postgres. For example:

```sh
apt install postgresql-16
```
