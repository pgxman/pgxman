## MacOS

On MacOS, you do not need to install Postgres. pgxman will [use a container](container) to emulate a Linux environment.
pgxman will support native homebrew installation in the future.

## Linux

<Note>At this time, only Ubuntu Jammy (22.04) and Debian Bookworm (12.x) are supported.</Note>

pgxman requires using [the Postgres Global Developer Group (PGDG) apt repository][pgpg-apt] to install Postgres. To add this
repository, run:

```sh
sudo apt install -y postgresql-common gnupg2
sudo /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.sh
```

Once the repository is installed, you can install your desired version of Postgres. For example:

```sh
sudo apt install postgresql-16
```

Support for other Postgres distributions are being considered. Please upvote (or file a new issue) if there is a
distribution of Postgres you would like to see supported.
