# Installing Postgres

You must either manually install your desired version of Postgres or use the
default version provided by your distribution when installing extensions with
pgxman.

## Default versions

* Debian Bookworm: Postgres 15
* Ubuntu Jammy: Postgres 14

## Automatic installation

Because pgxman declares the appropriate version of `postgresql` as a dependency,
pgxman will automatically try to install the specified version of Postgres when
installing an extension. For example:

```console
pgxman install pgvector@15
```

In this case, the pgvector package for PG 15 will have `postgresql-15` package
as a dependency, so it will try to install it if it is not already installed.

## Installing other versions

We highly recommend using the Postgres Global Developer Group (`pgdg`)
Apt repository to install other versions. To add this repository, run:

```console
apt install -y postgresql-common gnupg2

/usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.sh
```
