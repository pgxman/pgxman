title: "Installing Postgres"
---

## MacOS

On MacOS, you do not need to install Postgres. pgxman will [use a container](container) to emulate a Linux environment.
pgxman will support native homebrew installation in the future.

## Linux

<Note>At this time, only Ubuntu Jammy and Debian Bookworm are supported.</Note>

pgxman assumes you likely already have Postgres installed, and because there are many ways to install
Postgres, it does not try to install it for you. pgxman will detect your version of Postgres by looking
for `pg_config`.

If you do not have Postgres installed, we recommend either using the default version included with the distro,
or use the Postgres Global Developer Group (`pgdg`) repository.

### Included versions

- Debian Bookworm: Postgres 15
  - `apt install postgresql-15`
- Ubuntu Jammy: Postgres 14
  - `apt install postgresql-14`


### Other versions

We highly recommend using the Postgres Global Developer Group (PGDG)
apt repository to install other versions. To add this repository, run:

```sh
sudo apt install -y postgresql-common gnupg2
sudo /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.sh
```

Once the repository is installed, you can install your desired version of Postgres. For example:

```sh
sudo apt install postgresql-16
```
